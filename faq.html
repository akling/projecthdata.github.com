  	<div class="question" id="whatIshData">What is hData?</div>
    <p>hData is a simple health IT exchange framework for the creation, storage, and exchange of health data. The core <a href="/documents.html#specifications">hData specifications</a> contains two components:</p>
  	<ol>
      <li>HL7 hData Record Format (HRF): The HRF describes an abstract architecture of how data is stored in multiple XML documents and is organized in a hierarchy. It also contains a concrete schema for the HRF meta-data. Records conforming to the HRF are called hData Records (HDRs).</li>
      <li>OMG hData RESTful Transport (HRA): When the HRF is represented as a web resource, this RESTful specification allows for modifying section documents, creation of new data, record transport, and management of the entire record through a simple Web API.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>In addition to the above technical specification, hData uses hData Content Profiles (HCP) to specify the actual content included in a particular hData record. These content profiles detail what fields are required to capture an allergy or condition. The philosophy is to use simple XML documents mapped directly to existing healthcare information models. For the purposes of compliance with the <a href="http://www.niem.gov/">National Information Exchange Model (NIEM)</a> lifecycle process, an hData Content Profile may be understood to be a specialization of the NIEM Information Exchange Package Documentation (IEPD).</p>
    <p>The hData project had initially created schemas for a Continuity of Care Content Profile, as well as lab orders and results. It is expected that Content Profiles will be submitted to standards organizations. Additionally, it is assumed that Content Profiles will be created to address different medical domains.</p>

  <div class="questionAnswer">
  	<div class="question" id="exchange">How will hData be used to exchange EHR health data?</div>
    <p>At its core, hData is a simple way of organizing data into small pieces in folders, with a corresponding set of XML Schemas or other appripriate media types (such as e.g. PDFs, PNGs, or DICOM containers) to describe the small pieces. Because of this simplicity, it is easy to exchange information using hData.</p>
    <p>Currently, hData has one <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST" target="_external">RESTful</a> transport binding, which is being standardized at the Object Management Group.Future transports may include SMTP or XMPP transports. </p>
  </div>
  <div class="questionAnswer">
  	<div class="question" id="submitted">What is the standardization status of hData?</div>
  	<p>Please check the <a href="/standardization.html">Standardization</a> page for a detailed status. The goal is to make all of hData a nationally and internationally recognized standard.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="questionAnswer">
  	<div class="question" id="rfh">How does hData relate to the recently proposed Resource For Healthcare idea?</div>
    <p><a href="http://www.healthintersections.com.au/rfh/introduction.htm">Resources For Healthcare (RFH)</a> was recently (09-2011) proposed as a reponse to the HL7 Fresh Look Task Force question: "How would a complete health IT software stack look like, if HL7 re-did it today?"</p>
    <img src="/images/RFH View.png" width="250px" style="float:right" /> 
    <p>Conceptually, RFH is using a RESTful transport to allow the exchange of the simplified content. There is a signficant overlap with hData of the way transport within the RFH proposal is realized, so that it should be quite easy to reformulate RFH in hData terms. Based on discussions with the RFH authors, they are starting to find similar issues that drove hData development (such as metadata definition) - these problems have largely been solved within hData.</p>
    <p>Going forward, the RFH content model can be understood as a hData Content profile. </p>

  	<div class="question" id="license">What are the open source licensing details associated with hData?</div>
  	<p>hData is licensed under the <a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0" target="_external">Apache 2.0 open source license</a>.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="questionAnswer">
  	<div class="question" id="contribute">Can I contribute software source code to hData?</div>
  	<p>Code contributions will be accepted to hData as bug fixes and new feature proposals.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="questionAnswer">
  	<div class="question" id="standards">What standards will hData use?</div>
  	<p>hData is built using <a href="http://www.w3.org/XML/" target="_external">XML</a>, using <a href="http://www.w3.org/XML/Schema" target="_external">W3C XML Schema</a> to specify the grammar. The structure of hData closely resembles the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenDocument" target="_external">OpenDocument Format</a>.</p>
    <p>hData can be used to meet a number of health data needs, but initially, we are focusing on Continuity of Care. As such, much of the data vocabularies defined in hData model themselves after the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuity_of_Care_Document" target="_external">HL7 CCD</a> and <a href="http://www.astm.org/Standards/E2369.htm" target="_external">ASTM CCR</a>.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="questionAnswer">
  	<div class="question" id="vendor">Do I need to be an EHR vendor to use hData?</div>
  	<p>No. hData can be used by anyone interested in working with Health IT systems. hData is designed to make implementation fast and simple. Its simple serialization format and RESTful API make hData highly portable as well. While an obvious use of hData would be to expose the information stored in an EHR System, we hope that it will ease the development of all health applications by lowering the barrier to creating and consuming health data.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="questionAnswer">
  	<div class="question" id="languages">What programming languages will hData use?</div>
    <p>hData is based on XML, so it can be used with virtually any programming language. The MITRE team is working on developer kits in <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/" target="_external">Ruby</a> and <a href="http://www.java.com/en/" target="_external">Java</a>. The hData project will gladly accept any contributions for generating or consuming hData in other programming languages.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="questionAnswer">
  	<div class="question" id="background">What is the background of hData?</div>
  	<p>Electronic documentation of health care data is currently at the heart of the U.S. national discussion on healthcare reform. Electronic health records (EHRs) have the potential to increase physician efficiency, reduce costs, and promote standardized care. However, health data exchange interoperability and other usability issues have plagued system-wide adoption and have thus limited the expected benefits. hData offers a solution to these problems by using a simple XML framework for the creation, storage, and exchange of health data.</p>
    <p>Standards development of EHRs began with Health Level Seven (HL7) in the late 1980s. HL7, comprised of healthcare subject matter experts and information scientists, developed standards for the exchange, management, and integration of electronic healthcare information. The group first created the clinical document architecture (CDA), which was designed to address most of the documentation needs of any health care system. Consequently, this approach made the schema extremely flexible but overly complex, hard to implement interoperably, and difficult to manage. Around the same time, in a separate effort, a simplified continuity of care record (CCR)--not based on the CDA-- was created. Eventually, ASTM International, a highly regarded standards organization, adopted the CCR as its continuity of care record standard.</p>
    <p>Later, HL7 reconciled its standards with ASTM by taking data elements from the CCR and encoding them in the CDA, resulting in a new standard called the Continuity of Care Document (CCD). The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and its affiliated Health Information Technology Standards Panel (HITSP) recommended the CCD as an input standard for creating a national continuity of care standard. The result was initially published as the HITSP Construct 32 standard (C32), which has since expanded and grown more complex.</p>
    <p>CDA, C32, and related standards contain a number of significant shortfalls. These include the repeated use of overly abstract data structures and underspecified implementation, including lack of normative schema, lack of a clearly profiled code system, and imprecise data types. HITSP has recognized the complexity of these existing standards and completed an effort to “streamline” documentation on how to use them. However, while this document reordering may provide some help, exchanging continuity of care information will still take place in the same overly complex format, and the entire existing HITSP framework is not always able to deliver a comprehensive, interoperable set of specifications.</p>
    <p>hData was created to address these shortcomings. hData lowers the barrier to Health IT integration by focusing on ease of implementation.</p>

  <div class="questionAnswer">
  	<div class="question" id="significance">What is the significance of the name hData?</div>
  	<p>hData is a contraction of “health” and “Data;” with the capital “D” emphasizing the core importance of data. The hData team's goal is to make the creation, exchange, consumption, and storage of health data simple, secure, and private. As a result, we believe better health outcomes are sure to follow.</p>
